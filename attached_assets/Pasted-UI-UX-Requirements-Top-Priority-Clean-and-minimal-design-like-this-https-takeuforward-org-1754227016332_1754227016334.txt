UI & UX Requirements (Top Priority):
🔵 Clean and minimal design like this:
https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/

📱 Fully responsive (mobile-first)

Use a simple grid or table layout

Avoid bulky cards or unnecessary animations

No clutter or "overstyling" (keep padding/margins balanced)

🌗 Light/Dark theme toggle

Respect system theme by default

Smooth transitions between themes

Save preference in localStorage

🧠 User experience should feel native and intuitive

Navigation should be fast, clear, and minimal

All elements should be usable and readable on all devices

Use tooltips, icons, and subtle hover effects

🧩 Functional Requirements
🔐 Authentication:
Login/Register using Firebase Email/Password + Google

Save user info in Firestore

Detect admin via role field (role: "admin")

🧾 Dashboard for All Users:
Show problems by categories: DSA, SQL, etc.

Filter options:

Topic

Sub-topic

Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Status (Solved ✅ / Starred ⭐ / Unsolved)

Each problem entry should show:

Title (linked to question)

Difficulty (colored label)

Topic/SubTopic

Star toggle

Solve toggle

Editable note (autosaves or saves on blur)

🧑‍💻 Admin Panel:
Add problem (form): Title, Link, Difficulty, Topic, SubTopic, SheetType

Upload CSV/JSON using PapaParse

Preview before uploading

Use Firebase batch writes

Edit/Delete problems inline or via modal

🔐 Routing & State:
Use React Router with Public/Private/Admin route guards

Use Zustand or Context API for:

Auth

Theme

User metadata (role, UID, etc.)

📁 Firebase Structure (Firestore):
yaml
Copy
Edit
users/{uid}:
  name
  email
  role: "admin" | "user"
  solvedProblems: []
  starredProblems: []
  notes: { problemId: note }

problems/{autoId}:
  title
  link
  difficulty
  topic
  subTopic
  sheetType
🎨 Design Instructions:
Follow the clean structure and spacing from Striver's sheet

Use a grid or table, not bulky card-based layout

No bright color overuse, keep tones soft and readable

Use Tailwind's bg-gray-100, text-gray-800, hover:bg-gray-200 styles

Use HeroIcons or Lucide icons, small size, consistent placement

Provide instant visual feedback on toggle/actions (like star/solved)

✅ Final Expectations:
Zero design clutter — should look professional and simple

Works perfectly across all screen sizes

Fully functional theme toggle

Admin & User features working end-to-end

Easy-to-navigate UI, like Striver’s DSA sheet

Avoid complex UI elements unless necessary

All core features (auth, Firestore updates, routing) must work

Ready for deployment (Firebase Hosting compatible)
